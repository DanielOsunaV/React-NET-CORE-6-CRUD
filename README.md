# REACT CRUD USING .NET CORE 6.0 API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository contains the front end for the REACT CRUD using .NET Core 6.0 API basic, you can find the api code following the url: 
https://github.com/DanielOsunaV/Database-Api-CRUD-Gestores

this repository uses react states for the basic actions of a CRUD, comments are allowed, I hope this might by helpful for experimental developers on REACT and .NET CORE 6
